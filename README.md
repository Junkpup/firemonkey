## Theme:
Controlled forest fires are considered beneficial for forest growth. However, uncontrolled, large-scale forest fires can put biodiversity at risk, cause air pollution and water pollution. According to a Forest Survey of India (FSI) technical study, over 95% of forest fires in India are of anthropogenic origin (caused by human activity). A raging forest fire in Bandipur in the state of Karnataka, India wiped out 1000 hectares of forest and took the life of a forest guard. A report commissioned by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) estimates that nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by Australia's deadly 2019 bush fires. This game requires players to put out forest fires.
